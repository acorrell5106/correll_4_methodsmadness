Addison Correll's Methods Madness Progress

	In my Methods Madness program, I have created a system that checks a number to see if it is divisible by a certain number, making its specific shape. This is where the
methods come into play, checking to see if the number created by the for loop has a certain factor, creating the shape. For example, one of my methods checks the number from the for
loop and checks to see if it has a factor of four, and will create a quadrilateral if this is true. My methods are named for this purpose, such as "isTriangle" or "isHex" to help 
identify what is being checked to create the shape described. I have created all of these methods (up to "isDodec") and am currently making the shapes that will be created through 
these different methods. I am hoping to have the numbers from zero to one hundred be counted in the for loop, be given to the methods to check for factors, and then have them be
represented as their specific shape on the canvas, in a grid-like structure. So far, I still have to create all of the shapes, but I also have to consider creating a seperate for 
loop for the x and y coordinates. I'm not exactly sure how this would work, but I'll get to it after I get the shapes the way I want them to be. That's what I have some far, but hopefully I will gain a better knowledge of my program, making the appropriate alterations.
